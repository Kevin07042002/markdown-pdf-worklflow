# markdown-pdf-worklflow
A Github workflow for generating PDF files (presentations and documentations/scientific papers) from Markdown 

The PDF files are generated with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
Pandoc converts the Markdown file to [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and from LaTeX to PDF.

It is possible to use LaTeX themes. In the future the style attributes of the test files will be moved to a seperate style file.

The workflow is very simple at the moment and will be changed to convert multiple files.

Feel free to fork the repository. You may add a secret variable for your MAIL_ADDRESS.
